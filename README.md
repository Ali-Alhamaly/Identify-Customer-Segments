# Project Introduction:

In this project,  AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Solutions have provided two datasets one with demographic information about the people of Germany, and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales company. I've analyzed relationships between demographics features, organized the population into clusters, and seen how prevalent customers are in each of the segments obtained.

# Project Overview:
he data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany.

The main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. My job is to use unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company. Prior to applying the machine learning methods, I will also need to assess and clean the data in order to convert the data into a usable form.
